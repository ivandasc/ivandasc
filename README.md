# Simple Calculator in Python

This project is a simple calculator written in Python. It performs basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user inputs two numbers and chooses the desired operation, and the program calculates and displays the result.

## Features

- **Data Input**: The user must enter two numbers (num1 and num2). The user must specify the desired operation among:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)
  
- **Supported Operations**:
  - **Addition (+)**: Calculates the sum of the two numbers.
  - **Subtraction (-)**: Calculates the difference between the first and second number.
  - **Multiplication (*)**: Calculates the product of the two numbers.
  - **Division (/)**: Calculates the quotient of the first number by the second number. If the second number is zero, displays an error message for division by zero.

- **Validation and Error Messages**:
  - If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program will display the message "error: division by zero".
  - If the user enters an invalid operation, the program will display the message "invalid operation".

- **Output**: Displays the result of the operation or an error message.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
